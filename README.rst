Score Card Model
=======================
Credit scorecards are mathematical models which attempt to provide a quantitative
estimate of the probability that a customer will display a defined behavior
(e.g. loan default, bankruptcy or a lower level of delinquency) with respect to
their current or proposed credit position with a lender. Scorecards are built
and optimized to evaluate the credit file of a homogeneous population
(e.g. files with delinquencies, files that are very young, files that have very little information).
Most empirically derived credit scoring systems have between 10 and 20 variables.
Application scores tend to be dominated by credit bureau data which typically
amounts to over 80% of the predictive power from closer to 60% in the late 1980s
for UK scorecards. Indeed there has been an increasing trend to minimize applicant
or non-verifiable variables from scorecards which has increased the contribution of the credit bureau data.

Credit scoring typically uses observations or data from clients who defaulted
on their loans plus observations on a large number of clients who have not defaulted.
Statistically, estimation techniques such as logistic regression or probit are used
to create estimates of the probability of default for observations based on this historical data.
This model can be used to predict probability of default for new clients using
the same observation characteristics (e.g. age, income, house owner).
The default probabilities are then scaled to a "credit score."
This score ranks clients by riskiness without explicitly identifying their probability of default.

There are a number of credit scoring techniques such as: hazard rate modeling,
reduced form credit models, weight of evidence models, linear or logistic regression.
The primary differences involve the assumptions required about the explanatory
variables and the ability to model continuous versus binary outcomes.
Some of these techniques are superior to others in directly estimating the probability of default.
Despite much research from academics and industry, no single technique has been
proven superior for predicting default in all circumstances.

One of the most typical mistaken belief about credit rating is that the only trait
that matters is your credit ratingâ€“ whether you have actually made payments
on time as well as satisfied your monetary obligations in a prompt way.
Sure your payment background is essential, however it still just composes just
over one-third of your credit rating score. Furthermore, your repayment background
is only shown in your credit history.
